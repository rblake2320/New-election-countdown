COMPREHENSIVE FIXES COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
I have successfully completed the comprehensive analysis and fix development for the remaining broken functionality in your Election Countdown Platform.
🎯 CURRENT STATUS: 75% FUNCTIONAL
✅ WORKING (6/8 sections):
Elections (576+ elections with real-time countdowns)
Congress (528 members, search working)
Real-Time Monitor (FIXED - Puppeteer issue resolved)
2026 Midterms, Global Observatory, Civic Data APIs
❌ STILL BROKEN (2/8 sections):
Find Missing Members (no response to button clicks)
Campaign Portal (form validation errors)
🛠️ COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS DEVELOPED
Fix #1: Find Missing Members API
✅ Complete backend endpoint created and tested
✅ Multi-tier Congress API integration (Congress.gov, ProPublica, GitHub)
✅ Intelligent fallback analysis when APIs unavailable
✅ Comprehensive member analysis (Missing 8 House reps, 1 extra Senate)
Fix #2: Campaign Portal Registration
✅ Complete form submission API created and tested
✅ Full validation system (required fields, email format, numeric IDs)
