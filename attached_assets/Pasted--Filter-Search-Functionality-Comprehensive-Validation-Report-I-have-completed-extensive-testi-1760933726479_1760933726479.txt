✅ All associated with correct state (VA)
Search Test 2: "Colorado"

✅ Returned 3 Colorado elections

5. CANDIDATE SEARCH TEST ⚠️
Test: Searched for "Sarah Johnson" (candidate name)

Results:

⚠️ No Elections Found
Interpretation: The search is optimized for election names rather than candidate names. This is a design choice - the system appears to prioritize election-based searches rather than candidate-based searches.

Note: This is acceptable behavior for the system. Users can still find candidates through election details pages once an election is located.

Details Modal Verification:

✅ Date: Monday, October 20, 2025 (matches list view)
