Yes. Replit now has a native Databricks connector, but it is currently available only for Replit Enterprise/organization customers, not general free accounts.[1][2]

## Current connector status

Replit introduced “Enterprise Data Warehouse Connectors” that include Databricks alongside Snowflake and BigQuery, allowing apps built on Replit to connect directly to those warehouses.  Replit’s November 2025 changelog explicitly lists Databricks as one of the new enterprise data warehouse connectors now available to all enterprise customers.[2][3][1]

## Who can use it

These Databricks connectors are part of the enterprise/organization features, accessed through the Connectors panel in the Replit workspace, and require admin setup such as creating an OAuth app in Databricks and configuring access.  Individual/free users still primarily use Replit’s built‑in SQL database or other standard database options rather than the Databricks connector.[4][5][6][1]
